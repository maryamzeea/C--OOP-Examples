# C# Object-Oriented Programming Models

This repository contains three C# console applications that demonstrate **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** using real-world examples.
Each model is designed to clearly show how OOP works in practice through clean and understandable code.

## OOP Concepts Covered

* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism (method overriding)
* Arrays
* Constructors
* Method overriding
* String concatenation

## Models Included

### 1. Student Model

This model represents a **student record system**.

**Concepts used:**

* Abstraction using an abstract `Person` class
* Inheritance (`Student` and `GraduateStudent`)
* Encapsulation using private fields with properties
* Method overriding (`Introduce()` method)
* Constructors for initializing data
* String concatenation for output

**Purpose:**
To show how student data can be managed using OOP principles with proper data control.

### 2. Car Model

This model represents a **car hierarchy system**.

**Concepts used:**

* Abstraction using an abstract `Car` class
* Inheritance (`Sedan` → `Honda`)
* Method overriding (`Display()` method)
* Constructors for object initialization
* String concatenation for displaying car details

**Purpose:**
To demonstrate how different car types can share common behavior while having their own specific features.

### 3. Weapon Model

This model represents a **weapon system**.

**Concepts used:**

* Abstraction using an abstract `Weapons` class
* Inheritance (`RangedWeapon` → `Gun`)
* Polymorphism using a base class array
* Arrays to store multiple weapon objects
* Method overriding (`Display()` method)
* Encapsulation with validation
* Constructors
* String concatenation for output

**Purpose:**
To show how polymorphism works when multiple objects are stored and accessed through a base class reference.

## Common Features in All Models

* Use of **constructors** for data initialization
* Use of **method overriding**
* Use of **string concatenation** for output display
* Clear separation of responsibilities using OOP

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a practical reference for understanding **Object-Oriented Programming in C#** through multiple real-life based examples.
